# ðŸ§ª Exploring Data Science Projects

Hi! I'm currently learning and experimenting with data science by doing hands-on projects. My goal is to understand how to work with real-world data, find insights, and apply machine learning techniques along the way.

## ðŸ›  What I'm working on
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and visualization
- Trying out tools like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn
